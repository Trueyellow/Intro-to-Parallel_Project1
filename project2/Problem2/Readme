*********************Readme for code of Problem 2: Gaussian elimination********************

The attachment contains sequntial and pthread versions of code running Gaussian elimination.

To run on g++:

1. change directory to the code file direction
2. open terminal, type: $g++ GaussianPthread.cpp -o pthread -std=c++0x -lpthread  
3. to run sequential version, type: ./[file name] [matrix size]
   eg: ./sequential 2000
4. to run pthread version, type: ./[file name] [matrix size] [threshold]
   eg: ./pthread 2000 10

After the program finishes, the runtime will be shown as result.
